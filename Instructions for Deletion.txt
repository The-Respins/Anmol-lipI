
Normally you can uninstall a keyboard using the following method:

    Go to apps > installed apps
    Find the keyboard and uninstall it

    Try to add the keyboard to your language again
    IF THE KEYBOARD IS STILL THERE IT MAY BE BECAUSE THE DLL IS IN CACHE
    You can either figure out how to manually delete it, or take the simple route
    and just restart the computer.
