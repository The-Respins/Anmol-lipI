
Normally you can uninstall a keyboard using the following method:

    Go to apps and installed apps
    Find the keyboard and uninstall it
    Then try to add the keyboard to your language again

    IF THE KEYBOARD IS NOT UPDATED IT MAY BE BECAUSE THE DLL IS IN CACHE
    You can either figure out how to manually delete it, or take the simple route
    and just restart the computer.
