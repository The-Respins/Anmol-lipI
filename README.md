# Anmol-lipI
A simple Phonetic Punjabi Keyboard based on the commonly used layout referred to as "ਅਨਮੋਲ ਲਿਪੀ" (Anmol lipI)

I made this Punjabi(Gurmukhi) keyboard and figured I may as well share it. Here's some images. I used the name ਅਨਮੋਲ ਲਿਪੀ because that's how it's been referenced online. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

<ins>**Installing:**</ins> The names like AMD and INTEL for the MSI packages aren't actually only for that processor. For example I have an intel and only the one labeled AMD was compatible. So just try all the MSI's and then try the exe. If you're on MAC or Linux try to find a custom keyboard application that supports KLC format.

<ins>**Matra Patch:**</ins> Make sure to download and run the AHK executable to fix things like ੳੋ and ਅਾ. I would recommend adding it to startup apps. If you do not, you will have to run it every single time your computer starts.

  - **How to add it to startup:** right click while holding shift on the executable, click create shortcut, copy with ctrl+c. Hit windows +r and type shell:startup, hit enter. Paste in the shortcut with ctrl+v.

<ins>**Source:**</ins> If you wanna open the source file without downloading KLC, it'll work and open as a text file. The AHK source file will open with any text editor as well.
